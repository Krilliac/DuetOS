/*
 * CustomOS syscall gate — v0.
 *
 * One vector today: 0x80, reached from ring 3 via `int 0x80`. The gate
 * is a DPL=3 interrupt descriptor, so ring-3 code can issue the int
 * without #GP'ing; once delivered, the trap frame lands on the current
 * task's RSP0 kernel stack and isr_common calls into
 * `core::SyscallDispatch` via the main TrapDispatch.
 *
 * Calling convention (v0):
 *   - Syscall number in rax.
 *   - Args in rdi, rsi, rdx (up to three for the first pass — extend to
 *     r10, r8, r9 when a real consumer needs it).
 *   - Return value in rax. A syscall that never returns (SYS_exit)
 *     simply tail-calls sched::SchedExit from inside the dispatcher;
 *     the half-consumed trap frame is abandoned with its task.
 *
 * Syscall numbers are ABI — once published, NEVER renumber. Add new
 * numbers at the tail of the enum; retired numbers stay with a
 * `// reserved — do not reuse` comment.
 *
 * Context: kernel. `SyscallInit` runs once after IdtInit, before any
 * user task is spawned.
