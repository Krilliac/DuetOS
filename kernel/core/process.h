/*
 * CustomOS process + capability model — v0.
 *
 * A `Process` is the unit that owns user-visible state:
 *   - an `mm::AddressSpace` (its private PML4 and user-half tables)
 *   - a capability set (which privileged kernel operations it can
 *     request)
 *   - a name + pid for diagnostics
 *
 * A Task (see kernel/sched/sched.h) is a single thread of execution.
 * Every ring-3-bound Task belongs to exactly one Process; kernel-only
 * Tasks (idle, reaper, workers, drivers) have `process == nullptr`.
 * Multi-threaded processes (several Tasks sharing one Process)
 * become possible the day we grow ProcessRetain() callers beyond
 * "one retain per create"; the refcount is there already.
 *
 * ## Capability model
 *
 * Every syscall that lets user-mode observably affect the world
 * outside its own address space MUST be gated on a capability.
 * "Observably affect the world" = write to a device, spawn a task,
 * touch a file, send an IPC message, read a clock that reveals host
 * timing, etc. Syscalls that only read or mutate the caller's own
 * address space (SYS_GETPID, SYS_YIELD, SYS_EXIT) are unprivileged.
 *
 * Caps are a u64 bitmask. Up to 64 distinct caps today — more than
 * enough for v0. Promote to a variable-size array if we ever exceed
 * that.
 *
 * Profiles:
 *   - `kProfileSandbox` — empty set. The canonical "untrusted EXE"
 *     profile: zero ambient authority. Every syscall except
 *     GETPID / YIELD / EXIT returns -1. The process's address
 *     space is its entire observable universe — which is the
 *     "malicious code thinks its sandbox is the OS" goal.
 *   - `kProfileTrusted` — every defined cap. For internal kernel-
 *     shipped userland (the smoke tasks, init process, etc.).
 *
 * New caps are added at the END of the enum. Never renumber — a
 * capability number is ABI: a process image stored on disk with a
 * "requested caps" manifest would break if we reshuffled.
