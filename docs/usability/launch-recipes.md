# DuetOS Usability Campaign — Per-App Launch Recipes

This is the launch recipe the Phase 2 exploration fan-out follows. Every
desktop app is reachable by one of two mechanisms, both driven by
`tools/test/drivers/explore-app-driver.py` (env `EXPLORE_LAUNCH`):

- **`icon`** — double-click the app's desktop icon at
  `(EXPLORE_ICON_X, EXPLORE_ICON_Y)`. Only the 9 registered desktop
  icons have this path.
- **`startmenu`** — keyboard-navigate the built-in Start menu. Works for
  **every** registered app. The driver looks the app up in its
  `LAUNCH_NAV` table and emits the sendkey sequence below.

## Start-menu mechanism (why it's the most reliable)

The built-in Start menu (`kernel/core/boot_tasks.cpp`, opened by the
taskbar **DUET** button or **Ctrl+Esc**) is a nested submenu structure.
Keyboard navigation is fully wired (`kernel/drivers/video/menu.cpp`
`MenuFeedKey` → dispatch in `boot_tasks.cpp` L486-507):

- **Ctrl+Esc** toggles the menu; on open the kernel **auto-hovers the
  first activatable row** (root row 0 = APPS).
- **Down/Up** move the highlight, **wrapping** and **skipping separators
  and disabled rows** (`MenuMoveHover`). So step counts are measured in
  *activatable rows only* and stay stable regardless of separator
  placement.
- **Right** opens the highlighted submenu; the submenu also auto-hovers
  its first activatable row (row 0).
- **Enter** activates the highlighted row → `DispatchMenuAction`.

Pure `sendkey` — no pixel-targeting of menu geometry — which makes it far
more robust than clicking menu rows. The driver uses **0.18 s per
keypress**: a faster burst drops a press (the hover advance runs under the
compositor lock on the kbd-reader thread and coalesces if the redraw
hasn't caught up). The first validation run at 0.08 s landed one row short
(fired Files instead of Clock); 0.18 s fixed it deterministically.

### Sequence

```
ctrl-esc                 # open menu, root auto-hovers row 0 (APPS)
down  × root_steps       # highlight the target submenu
right                    # open it, submenu auto-hovers row 0
down  × sub_steps        # highlight the target app
ret                      # activate
```

### Root menu order (activatable rows)

`USER APPS` is disabled+skipped on a normal boot (no `/APPS` shortcuts),
so it is **not** counted in `root_steps`:

| root_steps | submenu      |
|-----------:|--------------|
| 0          | APPS         |
| 1          | UTILITIES    |
| 2          | SYSTEM       |
| 3          | SCREENSHOT (leaf action, not a window) |
| 4          | POWER        |

## Per-app recipe table

`icon X Y` = `EXPLORE_LAUNCH=icon EXPLORE_ICON_X=X EXPLORE_ICON_Y=Y`.
`startmenu` rows give `(root_steps, sub_steps)` — the driver's `LAUNCH_NAV`
key is the `EXPLORE_APP` value.

Icon centres derive from the grid in
`kernel/drivers/video/desktop_icons.cpp` (origin 20,24; col stride 96; row
pitch 92; tile centre +42,+42; 7 icons/column) and the registration order
in `kernel/core/boot_bringup.cpp` L3641-3649.

### Apps with no GUI window (intentionally excluded from the fan-out)

- **screenshot** — root `SCREENSHOT` (action 50) is a one-shot capture, not
  a window. It is not an "openable app"; the exploration grader should
  treat it as an action, not a launch target.

## Validation evidence (2026-06-07)

Three non-icon apps launched via `EXPLORE_LAUNCH=startmenu` and
vision-confirmed open from the post-launch screendump:

| App     | Serial confirmation        | Window seen on screen |
|---------|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| clock   | `RAISED CLOCK` (action 0x69)| digital clock 11:52:43 + CLOCK/STOP/ALRM/TIMR tabs |
| charmap | `RAISED CHARACTER MAP` (0x74)| full glyph grid + RNGE/COPY + "U+FE (254)" |
| sysmon  | `RAISED SYSTEM MONITOR` (0x72)| UPTIME/POOL header + HEAP%/FRAGMENTATION graphs |

The icon path was regression-checked: `EXPLORE_LAUNCH=icon EXPLORE_APP=files`
still opens the FILES window (Computer icon double-click → DISK:/ listing).
